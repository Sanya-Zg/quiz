#### Description:  

This is an interactive web quiz that allows users to test their knowledge in various categories. Currently, it includes HTML, CSS, JS, and Accessibility, but the number of categories can be expandedâ€”this is just a short demonstration. The project is built using web technologies and has a simple, intuitive interface. The main goal of this quiz is to make learning fun and engaging.  

First, in the **Answers** tab, you can review the questions along with a brief explanation that describes the correct answer.  
In the **Quiz** tab, you can select a quiz by topic. Each question has four answer choices (only one is correct). When selecting the correct answer, the button's border turns green, and a green icon appears. If the answer is incorrect, the button's border turns red, and a red icon appears. If no answer is selected, a red message appears at the bottom, prompting you to choose an answer.  
At the end of the quiz, you can see how many correct answers you provided.  
All data is retrieved from a `.json` file using the `fetch()` function.
